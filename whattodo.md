# Project Log & To-Do

This file tracks all changes, instructions, errors, and fixes for the Artisan App project. Update this file with every significant change, error, and solution.

## Change Log
- **[INIT]** Project structure set up with navigation folders and screens.
- **[ADD]** Navigation system implemented (`App.tsx` now uses `RootNavigator` and `NavigationContainer`).
- **[ADD]** Installed React Navigation packages and dependencies.
- **[ADD]** Created comprehensive `README.md` for project overview and onboarding.
- **[UPDATE]** Changed onboarding flow: After completing onboarding, user is navigated to WelcomeScreen, which then automatically transitions to LoginScreen after a short animated welcome.
- **[ENHANCE]** WelcomeScreen now features animated logo, brand illustration, and improved UI/UX with smooth transitions and loading indicator.
- **[FIX]** Updated OnboardingScreen to set onboardingCompleted and navigate to WelcomeScreen instead of LoginScreen directly.
- **[ADD]** Registration now saves userType (customer or artisan) to AsyncStorage.
- **[FEATURE]** RootNavigator now checks userType from AsyncStorage and switches between UserNavigator and ArtisanNavigator accordingly.
- **[UPDATE]** LoginScreen now checks userType after login and navigates to the correct home screen (ArtisanDashboard or Home).
- **[ENHANCE]** ProfileScreen now uses a modal for logout confirmation. Logout updates global auth state (AuthContext), which triggers RootNavigator to switch to AuthNavigator and show WelcomeScreen.
- **[ADD]** Implemented AuthContext for global authentication state and logout flow.
- **[ADD]** Added new screens for artisans:
  - **Account Settings** (profile, password, notifications, logout)
  - **Account Details** (view artisan info)
  - **Notifications** (modern notification list)
  - **Settings** (notification preferences, theme, logout)
- **[ENHANCE]** All new screens are accessible from the artisan dashboard (three-dots menu and bell icon).
- **[ENHANCE]** Navigation is now consistent for both user and artisan flows.
- **[ENHANCE]** All dashboard icons and stats use professional Ionicons.
- **[ANALYSIS]** Identified all unimplemented files and placeholders in the codebase for prioritization.
- **[COMPLETE]** **PaymentOptions Component** - Full implementation with next button functionality, payment timing options, payment methods, and navigation flow.
- **[ADD]** **PaymentConfirmationScreen** - Handles different payment flows based on selected payment method.
- **[ADD]** **BookingSuccessScreen** - Shows success message and booking details after payment/booking confirmation.
- **[ADD]** **PaymentDemoScreen** - Demo screen showing how to use the PaymentOptions component.
- **[COMPLETE]** **PaymentInputScreen** - Comprehensive payment input forms for all payment methods with validation and user-friendly interface.
- **[FIX]** **Navigation Setup** - Added all payment screens to UserNavigator and navigation types for proper routing.
- **[COMPLETE]** **ReviewClients Screen** - Enhanced client review management with back navigation, overall rating summary, job type display, and improved UI with 5 sample reviews.
- **[COMPLETE]** **EarningsAnalytics Screen** - Comprehensive earnings dashboard with back navigation, trend indicators, performance insights, enhanced charts, and additional analytics metrics.
