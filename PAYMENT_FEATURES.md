# Payment Features Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the payment features that have been implemented in the Artisan App booking system, specifically the ability to choose payment timing (before delivery or after delivery) and payment methods during the booking process.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Timing Options

Users can now choose between two payment timing options when creating a booking:

- **Pay Before Service**: Payment is processed immediately when the booking is confirmed
- **Pay After Service**: Payment is due after the service is completed and the user is satisfied

### 2. Payment Methods

The following payment methods are supported:

- **Cash**: Pay with cash on site
- **Card**: Credit or debit card payment
- **Mobile Money**: Mobile money transfer
- **Bank Transfer**: Direct bank transfer

### 3. Payment Status Tracking

The system tracks payment status with the following states:

- **Pending**: Payment is awaiting processing
- **Paid**: Payment has been successfully completed
- **Refunded**: Payment has been refunded (e.g., for cancelled bookings)
- **Failed**: Payment processing failed

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Database Schema Updates

**File**: `backend/src/models/Booking.js`

Added new fields to the Booking model:
```javascript
paymentTiming: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['before_delivery', 'after_delivery'],
  default: 'after_delivery'
},
paymentMethod: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['cash', 'card', 'mobile_money', 'bank_transfer'],
  default: 'cash'
},
paymentStatus: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['pending', 'paid', 'refunded', 'failed'],
  default: 'pending'
}
```

#### 2. API Validation

**File**: `backend/src/routes/bookings.js`

Added validation for payment fields:
```javascript
body('paymentTiming')
  .optional()
  .isIn(['before_delivery', 'after_delivery'])
  .withMessage('Payment timing must be either before_delivery or after_delivery'),
body('paymentMethod')
  .optional()
  .isIn(['cash', 'card', 'mobile_money', 'bank_transfer'])
  .withMessage('Invalid payment method')
```

#### 3. Booking Controller

**File**: `backend/src/controllers/bookings.js`

The booking controller already supports payment timing and method handling:
- Creates bookings with payment timing and method
- Handles payment status updates based on booking lifecycle
- Manages payment refunds for cancelled bookings

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Payment Options Component

**File**: `components/shared/PaymentOptions.tsx`

A new reusable component that provides:
- Visual selection of payment timing options with benefits explanation
- Payment method selection with icons and descriptions
- Real-time summary of payment details
- Beautiful UI with gradient backgrounds and smooth interactions

#### 2. Booking Creation Screen

**File**: `screens/shared/CreateBookingScreen.tsx`

Enhanced booking creation flow that includes:
- Service and artisan information display
- Booking details form (date, time, description, special requests)
- Payment options integration
- Booking summary with payment information
- Form validation and submission

#### 3. Booking Display Components

**Files**: 
- `components/cards/BookingCard.tsx`
- `screens/shared/BookingDetailScreen.tsx`

Updated to display:
- Payment timing information
- Payment method with appropriate icons
- Payment status with color coding

#### 4. TypeScript Types

**File**: `types/booking.ts`

Added payment-related fields to the Booking interface:
```typescript
paymentStatus?: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'refunded' | 'failed';
paymentMethod?: 'cash' | 'card' | 'mobile_money' | 'bank_transfer';
paymentTiming?: 'before_delivery' | 'after_delivery';
paymentId?: string;
```

#### 5. Navigation Updates

**Files**:
- `navigation/types.ts`
- `navigation/UserNavigator.tsx`

Added CreateBookingScreen to the navigation stack for seamless booking flow.

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Booking Creation

1. User selects an artisan and service
2. User fills in booking details (date, time, description)
3. User selects payment timing:
   - **Before Service**: Secure booking, no payment worries, faster service start
   - **After Service**: Pay only when satisfied, no upfront payment, service quality guarantee
4. User selects payment method with clear descriptions
5. User reviews booking summary including payment information
6. User confirms booking

### 2. Payment Processing

- **Before Service**: Payment is marked as pending and processed when booking is confirmed
- **After Service**: Payment remains pending until service completion
- Payment status is updated throughout the booking lifecycle
- Refunds are automatically handled for cancelled bookings

### 3. Booking Management

- Users can view payment information in booking cards and detail screens
- Payment status is clearly displayed with color coding
- Payment method and timing are shown with appropriate icons

## Benefits
